# Terraform End-to-End Mastery

This project documents my hands-on journey with Terraform. As a DevOps Engineer with 5 years of experience, my goal is to demonstrate production-ready automation.

## Key Concepts Covered:
* **Lifecycle:** `init`, `plan`, `apply`, `destroy`.
* **State Management:** Moving from local state to Remote Backends for team collaboration.
* **Modularity:** Using Modules to write DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code.
* **Security:** Managing secrets via variables and protecting the state file.

## How to use:
1. Initialize: `terraform init`
2. Preview: `terraform plan`
3. Deploy: `terraform apply`
